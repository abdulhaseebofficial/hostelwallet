/**
 * The two things about recording a payment that only a real database can prove.
 *
 * Everything else about udhaar is covered through the API in
 * tests/e2e/debts.test.js. These two are different: one needs genuine
 * concurrency, and the other needs a failure in the middle of a transaction.
 * Neither can be faked convincingly, and both are the kind of bug that only
 * shows up under load, on someone else's money.
 *
 *   1. Two payments racing for the same debt must not both read the same
 *      balance and both write against it. The repository takes FOR UPDATE on
 *      the debt row; this checks that it works rather than trusting that it is
 *      spelled correctly.
 *
 *   2. If the ledger row is written and the debt update then fails, neither may
 *      survive. A payment recorded against a balance that never moved is money
 *      the student paid and the app forgot.
 *
 * Runs against whatever apps/api/.env points at, creates its own throwaway
 * account, and deletes it at the end.
