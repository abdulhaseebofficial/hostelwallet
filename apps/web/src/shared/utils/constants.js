/**
 * Front-end vocabulary. The backend owns the authoritative category list
 * (GET /api/meta); these defaults let the UI render instantly on first paint
 * and carry the presentation details the API has no opinion about.
 *
 * COLOUR NOTE
 * The nine category colours are a validated categorical palette: every
 * adjacent pair clears the colour-vision-deficiency and normal-vision
 * separation gates in BOTH light and dark mode, against this app's actual
 * surfaces (white / slate-900). Light and dark are two selected steppings of
 * the same eight hues, not an automatic flip.
 *
 * Rules that keep it valid:
 *  - slot 9 (Personal Care, teal) was added later and re-validated as part
 *    of the whole set in both modes against these surfaces; it introduces
 *    no new worst pair;
 *  - a colour belongs to a category, never to a rank, so filtering or
 *    re-sorting never repaints the survivors;
 *  - charts render categories in THIS order, so on-screen adjacency matches
 *    the pairs that were validated;
 *  - three light-mode slots sit under 3:1 contrast, so every chart also ships
 *    visible labels (legend with values) - identity is never colour alone.
