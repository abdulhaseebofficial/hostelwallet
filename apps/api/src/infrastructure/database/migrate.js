/**
 * The migration runner.  `npm run migrate`
 *
 * Migrations are numbered files in database/migrations/, applied in name order
 * and never edited once they have run anywhere. Each one is applied in its own
 * transaction and recorded in schema_migrations, so a second run is a no-op and
 * a failure leaves the database exactly as it was.
 *
 * This also runs on the first request of a cold process, because a platform
 * that imports the app and serves it gives no deploy step to hang it off. The
 * advisory lock is what makes that safe when several instances start at once:
 * the first takes the lock and applies, the rest wait and then find nothing to
 * do.
 *
 * 0001 is the schema as it already exists in production. It is written with
 * IF NOT EXISTS throughout, so recording it against a database that was
 * provisioned before this runner existed changes nothing.
