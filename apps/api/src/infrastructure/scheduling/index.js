/**
 * Scheduling adapter.
 *
 * The two background jobs are plain async functions that can be called from
 * anywhere - a cron tick, an HTTP handler, a test - and are safe to call twice.
 * That matters because in-process cron only fires while a process is alive,
 * which a serverless deployment cannot promise. The same handlers are reachable
 * over HTTP so an external scheduler can drive them punctually.
 *
 * Nothing here knows about Express, and registering the timers is opt-in, so
 * importing this module has no side effect.
