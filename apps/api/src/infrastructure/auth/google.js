 * Turning a Google ID token into a person we are willing to sign in.
 *
 * The browser gets an ID token from Google and posts it here. That token is a
 * JWT signed by Google, so the only thing that makes it trustworthy is actually
 * checking the signature against Google's published keys, and checking that the
 * token was issued *for this application* rather than for some other site the
 * same person also uses. `verifyIdToken` does both: signature, issuer,
 * audience and expiry. A token that fails any of them throws, and nothing
 * downstream ever sees it.
 *
 * Google's official library is used rather than hand-rolled JWKS handling
 * because key rotation, caching and algorithm pinning are exactly the details
 * that get quietly wrong in a hand-rolled version.
 *
 * There is deliberately no client secret and no redirect URI here. The ID-token
 * flow needs neither, which removes a secret that could leak and a redirect
 * allowlist that could be got wrong - two of the three classic OAuth mistakes,
 * simply by not having them.
